     *
     * - A callback
     *   - A function by its name as a string
     *   - A method by its name as a string (of the subscriber)
     *   - A method as an array (`[ object, 'method_name' ]`)

     * - An array with the method name and priority
     * - An array with the method name, priority, and number of accepted arguments
     *
     * For instance:
     *
     * - `[ 'hook_name' => 'function_name' ]`
     * - `[ 'hook_name' => 'method_name' ]`
     * - `[ 'hook_name' => [ object, 'method_name' ] ]`
     * - `[ 'hook_name' => Closure ]`
     * - `[ 'hook_name' => [ 'method_name', $priority ] ]`
